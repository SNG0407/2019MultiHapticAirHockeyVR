Hello fellow Unity user.
I created this asset so you don´t have too.
The Hdr included is not from my authory.

The airhockey has colliders added but you may have to adjust them because this asset initially was just to be a simple prop in a scene , and not to be used in a game.

Anyways you want me to make any modification for you contact me at clockwise.info@gmail.com , I usually answer in about 1 day .

I hope you like this asset as much as I do .

Good work and good luck on your projects!
